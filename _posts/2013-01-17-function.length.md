Little did I know, but the `Function` prototype has a `length` property. This is how Backbone knows whether your `comparator` function should be treated like a `_.sortBy()` function (that takes a single argument) or an `Array.sort()` function (that takes two arguments). Perhaps this is also how mocha knows whether your tests take a `done` parameter. And here I had assumed they were using `Function.toString()` and parsing out the parameters, as Prototype's [Function.argumentNames()](http://api.prototypejs.org/language/Function/prototype/argumentNames/) does.

One repercussion of this is that if you are passing a single-argument function as a `comparator`, you have to be careful to not `.bind()` or `_.wrap()` it, or Backbone will assume it is a two-argument function.
