Sublime Text's multiple cursor feature (hold down `ctrl` while clicking to create more cursors) is great -- until you click in the wrong place. Fortunately, it is possible to remove a mis-placed cursor (though not altogether intuitive): hold down `alt` and use the middle mouse button (or clickable scroll wheel, if you don't have a middle mouse button) to remove the errant cursor.
