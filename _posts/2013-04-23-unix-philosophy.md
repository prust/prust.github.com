At Cornerstone, we've promoted using and writing "small and sharp" tools for as long as I can remember (influenced by [Andrew Hunt and David Thomas][1], among others). But I've never seen a community take this concept as far as the Node community has. It's been fun to see substack posting [some arguments][2] for this philosophy as well as some [how-to notes][3] -- and even more fun to see Isaac Schleuter, the gatekeeper / BDFL of node, write a piece on it: [Unix Philosophy and Node.js][4]
