I'm not sure why I never noticed before, but `String.substr()` isn't actually in the ECMAScript standard. The 3rd edition of the ECMAScript spec does mention it in the non-normative annex in order to "suggest uniforn semantics for such properties without making [them] part of this standard".

There are already two methods in the standard that do essentially the same thing, `String.slice()` and `String.substring()`. My preference is `String.slice()` because it supports negative indexes, doesn't have confusing argument-swapping behavior ("if indexA is larger than indexB, then the effect of substring is as if the two arguments were swapped") and its API is similar to `.slice()` for Arrays and string slicing in other languages.
